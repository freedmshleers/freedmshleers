A cash offer is particularly useful in highly competitive real estate markets. It could also expedite the process if you need to finish a purchase within a certain time frame. 

Depending on your income stability compared to your liquid assets, making a cash offer may be appealing to avoid the loan approval process. Freelancers or self-employed buyers, for example, might find making an upfront all-cash offer more convenient and reliable than financing a mortgage, which hinges on employment verification, monthly income statements, and other documentation that is often more stable for traditionally employed individuals.
