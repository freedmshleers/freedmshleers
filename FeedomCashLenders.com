 Businesses use cash books to document all of their cash transactions. This fundamental accounting tool tracks both incoming and outgoing cash flows, providing businesses with real-time clarity about their cash position.

By providing detailed documentation of each transaction, including dates, reference numbers, and full descriptions, it becomes much harder for errors or fraudulent activities to go unnoticed. This level of detail helps businesses maintain accurate financial records and meet various accounting requirements.
