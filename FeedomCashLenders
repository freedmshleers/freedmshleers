The cash book's structure follows a systematic format to facilitate easy recording and reference of cash transactions.

Cash books can be formatted in different ways. Some include separate columns for credits vs. debits. Others may simply put debits in parentheses "( )" or use a "-" sign to indicate an outflow. Others follow a double-entry format where the left side, known as the debit side, records all cash receipts, while the right side, the credit side, documents all cash payments.
